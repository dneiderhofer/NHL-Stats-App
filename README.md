# NHL Stats App

This program is used to track statistics from the National Hockey League.
Stats are tracked in real-time for the 2019-2020 season and they are pulled from a website that is used as a database.
This project was created using Android Studio software and programmed with the Java language and XML markup language.
This is my Senior Project for my BS in Computer Science at Ramapo College of New Jersey.
